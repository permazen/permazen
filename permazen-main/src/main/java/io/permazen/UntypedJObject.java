/**
 * Represents a {@link JObject} for which no Java model type is defined in the instance's associated schema version.
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are used to represent objects with a type that is defined in some older schema version
 * but not in the current schema version. This situation can occur when a new schema drops a previously defined
 * Java model type, yet for which objects of that type still exist in the database. If encountered, such objects
 * will be represented by instances of this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * All object fields are still fully accessible, but they must be accessed via introspection using the
 * {@link JTransaction} field access methods, with the {@code upgradeVersion} parameter set to false
 * (to prevent a {@link TypeNotInSchemaVersionException}).
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose a schema update replaces a field referencing {@code Account} with a simple {@link String}
 * field containing the account ID. Then the corresponding schema migration might look like this:
 * <pre>
 *      &#64;OnVersionChange
 *      private void applySchemaChanges(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; oldValues) {
 *          if (oldValues.containsKey("account")) {                         // was replaced with "accountId"
 *              final JObject acct = (JObject)oldValues.get("account");     // acct has type UntypedJObject
 *              final JTransaction jtx = this.getTransaction();
 *              final String acctId = (String)jtx.readSimpleField(acct.getObjId(), 12345, false);
 *              this.setAccountId(acctId);
 *          }
 *          // ...etc
 *      }
 * </pre>
