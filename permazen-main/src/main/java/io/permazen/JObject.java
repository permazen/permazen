/**
 * Interface implemented by {@link Permazen} Java model objects.
 *
 * <p>
 * All {@link Permazen} database objects are instances of runtime-generated sub-classes of user-provided Java model types.
 * These generated subclasses will always implement this interface, providing convenient access to database operations.
 * Therefore, it is convenient to declare Java model classes {@code abstract} and {@code implements JObject}.
 * However, this is not strictly necessary; all of the methods declared here ultimately delegate to one of the
 * {@link JTransaction} support methods.
 *
 * <p><b>Object Identity and State</b></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Every {@link JObject} has a unique 64-bit object identifier, represented as an {@link ObjId}.
 * All {@link JObject} instances are permanently {@linkplain #getTransaction associated} with a specific
 * {@linkplain JTransaction transaction}, and are the unique representatives for their corresponding {@link ObjId}
 * in that transaction. All field state derives from the associated transaction.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are two types of transactions: normal transactions reflecting an open transaction on the underlying
 * key/value database, and {@linkplain SnapshotJTransaction snapshot transactions}, which are in-memory containers
 * of object data. Snapshot transactions are fully functional, supporting index queries, object versioning, etc.
 *
 * <p><b>Copying Objects</b></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface provides methods for copying a graph of objects between transactions, for example, from an open
 * key/value database transaction into an in-memory snapshot transaction ("copy out"), or vice-versa ("copy in").
 * A graph of objects can be copied by specifying a starting object and either a list of reference paths, or
 * a cascade name (see {@link io.permazen.annotation.JField &#64;JField}). Object ID's can be remapped during
 * the copy if necessary, e.g., to ensure existing objects are not overwritten (see {@link CopyState}).
 *
