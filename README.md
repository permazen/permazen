A dumping ground for various useful Java classes and ant build macros that have evolved over time from repeated use in several different projects.

Highlights:
  * A few additions to [Spring](http://www.springframework.org/) integration (see [org.dellroad.stuff.spring](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/spring/package-summary.html))
  * Automated schema update tracking with Spring integration (see [org.dellroad.stuff.schema](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/schema/package-summary.html))
  * Several [Vaadin](http://vaadin.com) support classes, including:
    * [Spring integration](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/vaadin7/SpringVaadinServlet.html)
    * [In-memory](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/vaadin7/AbstractSimpleContainer.html) and [query-based](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/vaadin7/AbstractQueryContainer.html) containers
    * [Auto-generated container properties](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/vaadin7/ProvidesProperty.html) using annotations
    * [Auto-generated fields](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/vaadin7/FieldBuilder.html) using annotations
    * Support for both [Vaadin 6.x](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/vaadin/package-summary.html) and [Vaadin 7.x](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/vaadin7/package-summary.html)
  * Support classes for [JiBX](http://jibx.sourceforge.net/) (see [org.dellroad.stuff.jibx](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/jibx/package-summary.html))
  * Simple XML Persistence Objects (see [org.dellroad.stuff.pobj](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/pobj/package-summary.html))
  * Some handy [validation](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/validation/package-summary.html) support classes
  * Miscellaneous stuff for [I/O](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/io/package-summary.html), [networking](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/net/package-summary.html), [XML](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/xml/package-summary.html), [SQL](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/sql/package-summary.html), [DAO's](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/dao/package-summary.html), [strings and parsing](http://archiecobbs.github.io/dellroad-stuff/publish/reports/javadoc/index.html?org/dellroad/stuff/string/package-summary.html), etc.
