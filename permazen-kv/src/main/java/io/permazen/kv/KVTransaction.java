/**
 * {@link KVDatabase} transaction API.
 *
 * <p>
 * Provides a transactional view of a {@link KVStore}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances may throw {@link KVTransactionException} during any operation if the transaction cannot be continued.
 * In particular, {@link StaleTransactionException} is thrown by a transaction that is no longer open, and
 * {@link RetryTransactionException} is thrown when the transaction should be retried due to a transient
 * problem (such as a write conflict with another transaction).
 *
 * <p>
 * When {@link RetryTransactionException} is thrown by {@link #commit}, the transaction may have actually been committed.
 * Therefore, transactions should be written to be idempotent.
 *
 * <p>
 * No matter what state it is in, instances must support invoking {@link #rollback} at any time.
 *
 * <p>
 * If an instance throws a {@link KVTransactionException}, the transaction should be implicitly rolled back.
 * Any subsequent operation other than {@link #rollback} should throw {@link StaleTransactionException}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Except for {@link #rollback} and methods that just query status, implementations must throw {@link StaleTransactionException}
 * if {@link #commit} or {@link #rollback} has already been invoked, or if the {@link KVTransaction} instance is no longer usable
 * for some other reason. In particular, implementations should throw {@link TransactionTimeoutException} if an operation
 * is attempted on a transaction that has been held open past some maximum allowed time limit.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations are responsible for ensuring modifications to {@code byte[]} arrays after method
 * invocations do no harm. This usually means {@code byte[]} array parameters and return values must be copied.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations are not required to support accessing keys that start with {@code 0xff},
 * and if not may throw {@link IllegalArgumentException} if such keys are accessed.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: for some implementations, the data read from a transaction that is never {@link #commit}'ed is
 * not guaranteed to be up to date.

     * Watch a key to monitor for changes in its value.

     * <p>
     * When this method is invoked, {@code key}'s current value (if any) as read by this transaction is remembered. The returned
     * {@link Future} completes if and when a different value for {@code key} is subsequently committed by some transaction,
     * including possibly this one. This includes creation or deletion of the key.
     *
     * <p>
     * Key watches outlive the transaction in which they are created, persisting until they complete or are
     * {@link Future#cancel cancel()}'ed. When a {@link KVDatabase} is {@link KVDatabase#stop}'ed, all outstanding
     * key watches are implicitly {@link Future#cancel cancel()}'ed.
     *
     * <p><b>Caveats</b></p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Key watches are not without overhead; applications should avoid overuse. For example, consider creating a
     * single key that is used to consolidate modifications to some set of keys; at the Permazen layer, modification
     * to multiple objects and/or fields can detected and consolidated using an
     * {@link io.permazen.annotation.OnChange &#64;OnChange} method that increments a single {@link io.permazen.Counter}
     * field, whose key is then watched (to determine the key corresponding to a Java model object field, use
     * {@link io.permazen.JField#getKey(io.permazen.JObject) JField.getKey()}).
     *
     * <p>
     * Conceptually, detection of changes behaves as if by a background thread that periodically creates a new transaction
     * and reads the key's value (the actual implementation will likely be more efficient). This means a change that is
     * quickly reverted could be missed, and that multiple changes could occur before notification. In addition, spurious
     * notifications may occur, where the key's value has not changed.
     *
     * <p>
     * A key watch is only guaranteed to be valid if the transaction in which it was created successfully commits.
     * In particular, nothing is specified about how or whether {@link Future}s associated with failed transactions complete,
     * so the {@link Future}s returned by this method should not be relied on until after a successful commit (perhaps with
     * the help of a {@linkplain io.permazen.core.Transaction#addCallback transaction callback}).
     *
     * <p>
     * Key watch support is optional; instances that don't support key watches throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
     * Some implementations may only support watching a key that already exists.
     *
     * <p>
     * Note: many {@link KVDatabase} implementations actually return a
     * {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture}. However, listeners must not perform any
     * long running or blocking operations. Also, because the semantics of {@link RetryTransactionException} allow for
     * the possibility that the transaction actually did commit, "duplicate" listener notifications could occur.
     *
     * <p>
     * Key watch {@link Future}s that have not completed yet, but are no longer needed, must be {@link Future#cancel cancel()}'ed
     * to avoid memory leaks.
     *
     * <p>
     * Key watch support is indepdendent of whether the transaction is {@linkplain #setReadOnly read-only}.
