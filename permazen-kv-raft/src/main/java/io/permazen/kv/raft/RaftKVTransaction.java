   How transactions are managed
   ============================

   Transactions have a base term+index, which dictates the MVCC version of the database that the transaction sees,
   and (eventually) a commit term+index, which represents the log entry that must be committed (in the Raft sense)
   before the transaction itself may commit.

   When a transaction is created, a MutableView is setup using the log entry corresponding to the transaction's base
   term+index as the underlying read-only data. The transaction's consistency determines whether this log entry is
   the last log entry (LINEARIZABLE, EVENTUAL, UNCOMMITTED) or the last committed log entry (EVENTUAL_COMMITTED).

   For non-LINEARIZABLE transactions, the commit term+index can always be determined immediately: for EVENTUAL and
   EVENTUAL_COMMITTED, it is just the base log entry; for UNCOMMITTED, both values are zero. Therefore, UNCOMMITTED
   and EVENTUAL_COMMITTED transactions can always commit() immediately, because their commit term+index is already
   committed at the time the transaction starts.

   For LINEARIZABLE transactions, the base term+index must change over time as new log entries are received, to keep
   the transaction's view up-to-date. This is called "rebasing" the transaction. The rebase operation can fail due
   to read/write conflicts, whereby a newly added log entry mutates a key that has already been read by the transaction.
   If such a conflict is detected, the transaction must retry because it has seen what is now out-of-date information.
   On leaders, if a conflict occurs when rebasing a high priority transaction, the other transaction fails instead.

   For LINEARIZABLE transactions, the leader must be consulted (via CommitRequest) to determine the commit term+index.
   If the transaction is read-only, the commit term+index is taken from the leader's last log entry at the time the
   CommitRequest is received. In addition, the transaction must also wait until the leader's lease expiration time
   exceeds the leader's current time, to guarantee that the leader's last log entry is in fact up-to-date (i.e., there's
   not some other leader we don't know about who has already been elected).

   If the LINEARIZABLE transaction is read-write, the leader checks for conflicts caused by any log entries it has between
   the transaction's base log entry and the leader's last log entry, then appends a new log entry, and returns the new log
   entry as the transaction's commit term+index in a CommitResponse. Followers do not need to rebase beyond the base
   term+index that was sent to the leader in the CommitRequest, because the leader takes over conflict detection from that
   point as just described.

   When a follower transaction is set read-only, the follower requests a commit term+index from the leader immediately
   (linearizability only guarantees transactions see the database state as it existed at some time between begin and
   commit, and for the purposes of minimizing conflicts, the sooner we take that "snapshot" the better). In any case,
   followers must continue to rebase read-only LINEARIZABLE transactions until the commit term+index is received.

   If a follower transaction's base log entry is ever overwritten in the Raft log, then the transaction fails immediately
   with a retry (unless UNCOMMITTED). This can occur both during normal execution, and while blocked in commit(). Therefore
   it's always the case that a transaction's base term+index actually exists in the node's Raft log, possibly compacted
   (unless UNCOMMITTED).

   CommitRequest's
   ---------------

   CommitRequest's are sent by followers to leaders for LINEARIZABLE transactions. For read-write transactions, they are
   sent when commit() is invoked, and contain both the transaction's reads and writes. For read-only transactions, the
   CommitRequest is sent as soon as possible, i.e., as soon as it is known that the transaction is read-only. This is
   allowed because the "up-to-date" guarantee of LINEARIZABLE is only that the transaction sees the database as it
   existed at some point in time between begin() and commit().

   When commit() is invoked, the thread blocks until the commit term+index log entry is committed. The leader's response
   may be delayed or lost; if so the transaction times out.

   Compacting Log Entries
   ----------------------

   A transaction's base log entry, if committed, may be applied into the state machine without affecting the transaction
   due to the view being based on a read-only AtomicKVStore snapshot, which persists until closed.

   Therefore because LINEARIZABLE transactions are always rebased to the last log entry (or their commit log entry, at which
   point rebasing stops), and all other transactions are never rebased, there is no reason for followers to not apply committed
   log entries immediately.

   For leaders, the situation is more complicated. Applying committed log entries too aggressively can cause these issues:

    o If some follower has not received a log entry, but the leader has applied that log entry to its state machine and
      discarded it, then the only way the follower can be synchronized is via InstallSnapshot (i.e., full state machine dump),
      which is costly.

    o In order to detect conflicts in a mutating LINEARIZABLE transaction received in a follower's CommitRequest, a leader
      must have access to the mutations associated with all log entries after the transaction's base term+index. If any of
      these have already been applied to the state machine and discarded, the leader has no choice but to return a retry error.

   Actually, these issues also apply to followers, in the sense that they could become leaders at any time.

   To address these issues, leaders remember up to Log.MAX_APPLIED already-applied log entries. However, once it is known
   that all followers have received an already-applied log entry, then it can be discarded. This is because followers keep all
   transactions rebased to their last log entry, and so, under the assumption that message re-ordering is rare or impossible,
   any CommitRequest a leader receives will have a base index >= that follower's last log entry index.

   To save memory, we discard the Writes object (which is an in-memory representation of the entry's mutations) associated
   with already-applied log entries. This is just an optimization: conflict detection is still possible by re-reading the
   mutations from disk (see LogEntry.getMutations()), which should only be needed if a follower gets so far behind that its
   last log entry index is less than the leader's commit index (because followers always rebase to their last log entry).

   Lock Order
   ----------

   If locks are to be obtained on both this.raft and this.view, the order is: (1) this.raft, (2) this.view
