extends <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.lang">Object</a>
implements <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/KVDatabase.html" title="interface in org.jsimpledb.kv">KVDatabase</a></pre>
<div class="block">A distributed <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/KVDatabase.html" title="interface in org.jsimpledb.kv"><code>KVDatabase</code></a> based on the Raft consensus algorithm.

 <p>
 Raft defines a distributed consensus algorithm for maintaining a shared state machine.
 Each Raft node maintains a complete copy of the state machine. Cluster nodes elect a
 leader who collects and distributes updates and provides for consistent reads.
 As long as as a node is part of a majority, the state machine is fully operational.

 <p>
 <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/RaftKVDatabase.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft"><code>RaftKVDatabase</code></a> turns this into a transactional key/value database with linearizable ACID semantics.

 <p><b>Implementation Details</b></p>

  <ul>
  <li>The Raft state machine is the key/value store data.</li>
  <li>Unapplied log entries are stored on disk as serialized mutations, and also cached in memory.</li>
  <li>Concurrent transactions are supported through a simple optimistic locking MVCC scheme (similar to that used by
      <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/mvcc/SnapshotKVDatabase.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.mvcc"><code>SnapshotKVDatabase</code></a>):
      <ul>
      <li>Transactions execute locally until commit time, using a <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/mvcc/MutableView.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.mvcc"><code>MutableView</code></a> to collect mutations.
          The <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/mvcc/MutableView.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.mvcc"><code>MutableView</code></a> is based on the local node's last unapplied log entry,
          if any (whether committed or not), or else directly on the underlying key/value store; this defines
          the <i>base term and index</i> for the transaction.</li>
      <li>Since the transaction's view incorporates all unapplied log entries down to the underlying
          compacted key/value store, transaction performance degrades as the number of unapplied log
          entries grows. Log entries are applied as soon as possible, subject to certain conditions, but
          in any case limits on the <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/RaftKVDatabase.html#setMaxUnappliedLogEntries-int-">the number of unapplied log entries</a>
          as well as their <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/RaftKVDatabase.html#setMaxUnappliedLogMemory-long-">total memory usage</a> are enforced.</li>
      <li>On commit, the transaction's <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/mvcc/Reads.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.mvcc"><code>Reads</code></a>, <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/mvcc/Writes.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.mvcc"><code>Writes</code></a>,
          base index and term, and any config change are <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/CommitRequest.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg">sent</a> to the leader.</li>
      <li>The leader confirms that the log entry corresponding to the transaction's base index is either not yet applied to its
          own state machine, or was its most recently applied log entry. If this is not the case, then the transaction's base
          log entry is too old (e.g., it was applied and discarded early due to memory pressure), and so the transaction is
          rejected with a <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/RetryTransactionException.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv"><code>RetryTransactionException</code></a>.
      <li>The leader verifies that the transaction's base term matches its log; if not, the transaction's base log entry has
          been overwritten, and the transaction is rejected with a <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/RetryTransactionException.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv"><code>RetryTransactionException</code></a>.
      <li>The leader confirms that the <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/mvcc/Writes.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.mvcc"><code>Writes</code></a> associated with log entries (if any) after the transaction's base log entry
          do not create <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/mvcc/Reads.html#isConflict-org.jsimpledb.kv.mvcc.Mutations-">conflicts</a> when compared against the transaction's
          <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/mvcc/Reads.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.mvcc"><code>Reads</code></a>. If so, the transaction is rejected with a <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/RetryTransactionException.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv"><code>RetryTransactionException</code></a>.</li>
      <li>The leader adds a new log entry consisting of the transaction's <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/mvcc/Writes.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.mvcc"><code>Writes</code></a> (and any config change) to its log.
          The associated term and index become the transaction's <i>commit term and index</i>; the leader then
          <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/CommitResponse.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg">replies</a> to the follower with this information.</li>
      <li>If/when the follower sees a <i>committed</i> (in the Raft sense) log entry appear in its log matching the
          transaction's commit term and index, then the transaction is complete.</li>
      <li>As an optimization, when the leader sends a log entry to the same follower who committed the corresponding
          transaction in the first place, only the transaction ID is sent, because the follower already has the data.</li>
      <li>After adding a new log entry, both followers and leaders "rebase" any open <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/Consistency.html#LINEARIZABLE"><code>Consistency.LINEARIZABLE</code></a>
          transactions by checking for conflicts in the manner described above.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For transactions occurring on a leader, the logic is similar except of course no network communication occurs.</li>
  <li>On leaders, committed log entries are not applied to the state machine immediately; instead they are kept around until all
      followers have confirmed receipt. The point of waiting is to avoid follower transactions being rejected because
      their base log entry has already been compacted. Assuming message reordering is unlikely or impossible and each node is
      rebasing committed entries as described above, once a follower has confirmed receipt of a committed log entry, there
      should be no further commit requests from that follower for transactions based on earlier log entries.</li>
  <li>For read-only transactions, the leader does not create a new log entry; instead, the transaction's commit
      term and index are set to the base term and index, and the leader also calculates its current "leader lease timeout",
      which is the earliest time at which it is possible for another leader to be elected.
      This is calculated as the time in the past at which the leader sent <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/AppendRequest.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg"><code>AppendRequest</code></a>'s to a majority of followers
      who have since responded, plus the <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/RaftKVDatabase.html#setMinElectionTimeout-int-">minimum election timeout</a>, minus a small adjustment
      for possible clock drift (this assumes all nodes have the same minimum election timeout configured). If the current
      time is prior to the leader lease timeout (expected normally), the transaction may be committed as soon as log entry
      corresponding to the commit term and index is committed (it may already be); otherwise, the current time is returned
      to the follower as minimum required leader lease timeout before the transaction may be committed.</li>
  <li>For read-only transactions, followers <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/CommitRequest.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg">send</a> the base term and index to the leader as soon
      as the transaction is set read-only, without any conflict information. This allows the leader to capture and return
      the lowest possible commit index to the follower while the transaction is still open, and lets followers stop
      rebasing the transaction (at the returned commit index) as soon as possible, minimizing conflicts.
  <li>Every <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/AppendRequest.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg"><code>AppendRequest</code></a> includes the leader's current timestamp and leader lease timeout, so followers can commit
      any waiting read-only transactions. Leaders keep track of which followers are waiting on which leader lease
      timeout values, and when the leader lease timeout advances to allow a follower to commit a transaction, the follower
      is immediately notified.</li>
  <li>Optional weaker consistency guarantees are availble on a per-transaction bases; see <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/RaftKVDatabase.html#OPTION_CONSISTENCY"><code>OPTION_CONSISTENCY</code></a>.
      Setting the consistency to any level other than <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/Consistency.html#LINEARIZABLE"><code>Consistency.LINEARIZABLE</code></a> implicitly sets the transaction
      to read-only.</li>
  </ul>

 <p><b>Limitations</b></p>

 <ul>
  <li>A transaction's mutations must fit in memory.</li>
  <li>An <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/mvcc/AtomicKVStore.html" title="interface in org.jsimpledb.kv.mvcc"><code>AtomicKVStore</code></a> is required to store local persistent state.</li>
  <li>All nodes must be configured with the same <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/RaftKVDatabase.html#setMinElectionTimeout-int-">minimum election timeout</a>.
      This guarantees that the leader's lease timeout calculation is valid.</li>
  <li>Due to the optimistic locking approach used, this implementation will perform poorly when there is a high
      rate of conflicting transactions; the result will be many transaction retries.</li>
  <li>Performance will suffer when the amount of data associated with a typical transaction cannot be delivered
      quickly and reliably over the network.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>
 In general, the algorithm should function correctly under all non-Byzantine conditions. The level of difficultly
 the system is experiencing, due to contention, network errors, etc., can be measured in terms of:
 <ul>
  <li>The average amount of time it takes to commit a transaction</li>
  <li>The frequency of <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/RetryTransactionException.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv"><code>RetryTransactionException</code></a>'s</li>
 </ul>

 <p><b>Cluster Configuration</b></p>

 <p>
 Instances support dynamic cluster configuration changes at runtime.

 <p>
 Initially, all nodes are in an <i>unconfigured</i> state, where nothing has been added to the Raft log yet and no
 cluster is defined. Unconfigured nodes are passive: they stay in follower mode (i.e., they will not start elections),
 and they disallow local transactions that make any changes other than as described below to create a new cluster.

 <p>
 An unconfigured node becomes <i>configured</i> when either:
 <ol>
  <li><a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/RaftKVTransaction.html#configChange"><code>RaftKVTransaction.configChange()</code></a> is invoked and committed within
      a local transaction, which creates a new single node cluster and commits its first log entry; or</li>
  <li>An <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/AppendRequest.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg"><code>AppendRequest</code></a> is received from a leader of some existing cluster, in which case the node
      records the cluster ID thereby joining the cluster (see below), and applies the received cluster configuration.</li>
 </ol>

 <p>
 A node is configured if and only if it has recorded one or more log entries. The very first log entry
 always contains the initial cluster configuration (containing only the node that created it, whether local or remote),
 so any node that has a non-empty log is configured.

 <p>
 Newly created clusters are assigned a random 32-bit cluster ID (option #1 above). This ID is included in all messages sent
 over the network, and adopted by unconfigured nodes that join the cluster (via option #2 above). Configured nodes discard
 incoming messages containing a cluster ID different from the one they have joined. This prevents data corruption that can
 occur if nodes from two different clusters are inadvertently "mixed" together on the same network.

 <p>
 Once a node joins a cluster with a specific cluster ID, it cannot be reassigned to a different cluster without first
 returning it to the unconfigured state; to do that, it must be shut it down and its persistent state deleted.

 <p><b>Configuration Changes</b></p>

 <p>
 Once a node is configured, a separate issue is whether the node is <i>included</i> in its own configuration, i.e., whether
 the node is a member of its cluster according to the current cluster configuration. A node that is not a member of its
 cluster does not count its own vote to determine committed log entries (if a leader), and does not start elections
 (if a follower). However, it will accept and respond to incoming <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/AppendRequest.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg"><code>AppendRequest</code></a>s and <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/RequestVote.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg"><code>RequestVote</code></a>s.

 <p>
 In addition, leaders follow these rules with respect to configuration changes:
 <ul>
  <li>If a leader is removed from a cluster, it remains the leader until the corresponding configuration change
      is committed (not counting its own vote), and then steps down (i.e., reverts to follower).</li>
  <li>If a follower is added to a cluster, the leader immediately starts sending that follower <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/AppendRequest.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg"><code>AppendRequest</code></a>s.</li>
  <li>If a follower is removed from a cluster, the leader continues to send that follower <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/AppendRequest.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg"><code>AppendRequest</code></a>s
      until the follower acknowledges receipt of the log entry containing the configuration change.</li>
  <li>Leaders defer configuration changes until they have committed at least one log entry in the current term
      (see <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/raft-dev/t4xj6dJTP6E/d2D9LrWRza8J">this discussion</a>).</li>
  <li>Configuration changes that remove the last node in a cluster are disallowed.</li>
  <li>Only one configuration change may take place at a time.</li>
 </ul>

 <p><b>Follower Probes</b></p>

 <p>
 This implementation includes a modification to the Raft state machine to avoid unnecessary, disruptive elections
 when a node or nodes is disconnected from, and then reconnected to, the majority.

 <p>
 When a follower's election timeout fires, before converting into a candidate, the follower is required to verify
 communication with a majority of the cluster using <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/PingRequest.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg">PingRequest</a> messages. Only when the follower has
 successfully done so may it become a candidate.  While in this intermediate "probing" mode, the follower responds
 normally to incoming messages. In particular, if the follower receives a valid <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/msg/AppendRequest.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft.msg"><code>AppendRequest</code></a> from the leader, it
 reverts back to normal operation.

 <p>
 This behavior is optional, but enabled by default; see <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/RaftKVDatabase.html#setFollowerProbingEnabled-boolean-"><code>setFollowerProbingEnabled()</code></a>.

 <p><b>Key Watches</b></p>

 <p>
 <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/RaftKVTransaction.html#watchKey-byte:A-">Key watches</a> are supported.

 <p><b>Mutable Snapshots</b></p>

 <p>
 <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/RaftKVTransaction.html#mutableSnapshot--">Mutable snapshots</a> are supported.

 <p><b>Spring Isolation Levels</b></p>

 <p>
 In Spring applications, the transaction <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/Consistency.html" title="enum in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft"><code>Consistency</code></a> level may be configured through the Spring
 <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/spring/JSimpleDBTransactionManager.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.spring"><code>JSimpleDBTransactionManager</code></a> by (ab)using the transaction isolation level setting,
 for example, via the <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.7.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Transactional.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in org.springframework.transaction.annotation"><code>&#64;Transactional</code></a> annotation's

 All Raft consistency levels are made available this way, though the mapping from Spring's isolation levels to
 <a href="../../../../org/jsimpledb/kv/raft/RaftKVDatabase.html" title="class in org.jsimpledb.kv.raft"><code>RaftKVDatabase</code></a>'s consistency levels is only semantically approximate:
